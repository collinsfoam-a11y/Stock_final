## 2026-04-30 - Standardizing Header Accessibility and Tactile Feedback
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons in the application header were missing both screen reader descriptions and tactile confirmation, which are essential for an inclusive and responsive mobile experience.
**Action:** Always implement `accessibilityRole="button"`, `accessibilityLabel`, and `Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light)` for header-level icon actions to ensure they are both discoverable and satisfying to use.
